# ASOT

This script lets you download the latest one file episode of a State of trance from http://www.asotarchive.org/.

This script was originally inspired from [https://github.com/HuwSy/ASOT-Archive], but I had to modify it to make it work for the new redesign on asotarchive.

###Requirements

`curl`

`wget`

*nix based machine. I have not tested it on Cygwin, but my guess it will work as long as you have `curl` and `wget`

### How to run.

`git clone https://github.com/a5hay/asot.git`

`chmod +x a-state-of-trance.sh`

`./a-state-of-trance.sh`


if you have any feedback, please message me on github.
